2048 game.

Game 2048 is a puzzle game where you have to combine the same numbers to get bigger numbers. The game begins with two tiles with the numbers "2" or "4", and each turn the player can move all the tiles on the field in one direction - up, down, right or left. When two identical numbers are merged, they are combined into one new tile with a number equal to the sum of the two old tiles. The goal of the game is to get a tile with the number 2048. If the field fills up and there is no more opportunity to make a move, the game will end.
